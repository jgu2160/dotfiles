Readme mostly copied from indiesquidge. ;D I've learned most of what I know about dotfiles from him. Actually, all.

Focused heavily on Tmux, Vim, Zsh, and Prezto integration.

## Installation

###Main Dotfiles:

clone the repo
``
cd ~
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jgu2160/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
``

Symlinking is handled via [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot):

``
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
``

###Vundle
Vim Plugins are handled via [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim),
which can be installed and automatically symlinked with this command
``
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
``
After which, the custom plugins can be installed.
``
vim +PluginInstall +qall
``
The plugins I use are documented inside of my vimrc file above each plugin.

### Prezto
[Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) is an amazing configuration
framework for Zsh. It provides nice aliases, functions, auto-completetions, and
pretty prompt themes.

The only downside to it is the installation, which I am in the process of making
it install automatically with my dotfiles. For now, you have to follow this process:

clone the repo into ~/.zprezto
``
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"
``

Run the following on your command line to have prezto configure it's Zsh preferences
``
setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N); do
ln -s "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
done
``

Read the docs on the main Prezto page to change your prompt, install modules (for nicely
    wrapped functions and aliases), and further customization.

###iTerm2

Colors for iTerm2 are stored in config/base16-shell. I currently use a heavily modified version of jellybeans.
